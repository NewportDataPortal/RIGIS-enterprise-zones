<descript>
<abstract>Rhode Island Enterprise Zones are authorized by the Distressed Areas Economic Revitalization Act of the Rhode Island General Laws (RIGL) §42-64.3 and are limited to not more than five (5) contiguous U.S. census tracts or portions thereof. Exceptions to the five (5) census tract rule are prescribed in RIGL §42-64.3-5. The zones are delineated by U.S. census 2010 boundaries and defined under RIGL §42-64.3-5. Enterprise zone designation and re-designation are based on a number of distressed criteria including poverty, unemployment, and median household and per capita incomes. As well as non-demographic factors like economic development opportunities and potential, and defined course of action plans that including local incentives, resources and services.</abstract>
<purpose>The Distressed Areas Economic Revitalization Act which spawned the Enterprise Zone Program was created to combat substantial and persistent levels of unemployment, blight, the spread of obsolete, dilapidated, and abandoned industrial and commercial structures and shrinking tax bases by stimulating economic revitalization, promote employment opportunities, and encourage business development and expansion in distressed areas.</purpose>
<supplinf>Enterprise Zone Designation Process: The Central Falls/Cumberland Enterprise Zone’s original designation was the result of a state wide RFP process; all subsequent re-designations were granted by the Rhode Island Enterprise Zone Council.

<procdesc>The original list of Enterprise Zone (EZ) Tracts (T), Block Group (BG), and Blocks (B) were adjusted due to changes in the 2010 census geography, new legislative bills being approved, or discrepancies with the legal EZ description.  This resulted in some T/BG/B being removed or added to an EZ.  The previous EZ dataset was based on 1990 census boundaries and many boundaries have changed since then.  Legal EZ descriptions were used to determine which 2010 Census T/BG/B were used to create the 2014 EZ data update, with assistance from Commerce RI (Victor Barros) and EZ municipal contacts.</procdesc>

<edomv>Central Falls/Cumberland</edomv>
<edomvd>The Central Falls/Cumberland Enterprise Zone was designated in 1992 and later expanded to include the Ashton and Berkley Mill Villages in the town of Cumberland. The zone consists of the entire city of Central Fall (all four (4) census tracts), a census tract in the adjacent Valley Falls section of Cumberland, and the aforementioned Ashton and Berkley Mill Villages in Cumberland. The main thoroughfare connecting Central Falls and Valley Falls is Broad Street, which is a heavily traveled commercial roadway, used to move goods to and from many of the zone’s industrial businesses. The Central Falls portion of the zone encompasses the entire one (1) square mile of the city, the most densely populated municipality in the state. The city and thus the zone is nearly completely developed (98%), leaving limited land for new development. The Valley Falls section of Cumberland begins at the northern edge of Central Falls, making up the southernmost portion of Cumberland. It is approximately one (1) square mile in size and relatively flat. It borders on the west and south by the Blackstone River.</edomvd>

<edomvd>The Cranston Enterprise Zone was designated in 1992 as a part of the Port of Providence Enterprise Zone.  It was later expanded to include block group 1 of census tract 135; census tract 141 which includes the site of the former Narragansett Brewery; census tract 136; census tract 137.01 and block groups 1 and 2 of census tract 138.

The zone includes the Elmwood/Wellington business corridor, the Rolfe Street Business District and Fields Point waterfront. The former Narragansett Brewery site is located between Cranston Street and Route 10 within minutes of downtown Providence and T.F. Green Airport in Warwick. It features 77 acres of fully-serviced land and a 150,000 square-foot facility. Highway access, high visibility and a mixed-use designation are some of the site’s benefits. Centrally located in the Greater Providence Trade area, the former brewery site is home to a large population - 600,000 people within a 10-mile radius – and a skilled workforce. The Fields Point site is located immediately south of the Port of Providence and is minutes from Interstate 95 and downtown Providence. The site is comprised of 27 acres of fully-serviced waterfront industrial real estate on the Cranston portion of the property and is adjacent to additional acreage at the Port of Providence.</edomvd>

<edomv>East Providence</edomv>
<edomvd>The East Providence Enterprise Zone was designated in 1995 and later expanded to include block group 2 of census tract 107.01 to capitalize on a potential significant economic development project at the Leonardo Farm property on the Wampanoag Trail. The zone consists of five (5) census tracts and a portion of a sixth comprising roughly the western half of the city. The total land area of the zone is approximately 8.0 square miles. The zone fronts upon the city’s waterfront and several tracts reflect their historical link to waterfront activities. When originally designated in 1995 total vacancy for industrial and commercial properties within the zone were relatively high. The Leonardo Farm Project never materialized so during their 2014 zone re-designation the city asked the EZ Council to remove block group 2 of census tract 107.01 and add block group 1 of census tract 105.01 which is primarily associated with the Westminster Industrial Park, an important commercial hub in the city. The EZ Council unanimously approved the city’s proposed amendment to the zone as a part of their 2014 zone re-designation.</edomvd>

<edomvd>The Pawtucket/Lincoln Enterprise Zone was designated in 1992 and contains four (4) contiguous census tracts in the city of Pawtucket and one (1) census tract in the town of Lincoln.There have been no substantive changes to the census tracts that make up the zone except that census tract 117.02 was re-selected to only include block group 1 – excluding blocks 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 and 1009 to better follow the 1990 boundary, which changes the area of the census tract included.  The Pawtucket tracts are along the western boundary of the city and extend north/south across the city from the Providence line in the south to the Lincoln and Central Falls line in the north. The Pawtucket portion of the zone contains 1293 acres and makes up approximately 23% of the city’s land area.

<edomv>Portsmouth/Tiverton</edomv>
<edomvd>The Portsmouth/Tiverton Enterprise Zone has been modified since its original designation in 1995: block group 1 of census tract 401.02 was added while block groups 1 and 2 of census tract 401.01 were deleted. In 2014 block group 2 of census tract 401.01 was reacquired as a part of the Portsmouth portion of the zone. The zone comprised two-thirds of Portsmouth and all of Tiverton, representing approximately 42 square miles with portions of three (3) census tracts in Portsmouth and all four (4) census tracts in Tiverton. The Portsmouth portion of the zone is one of three communities on Aquidneck Island where the major industry focus is centered on ocean sciences, maritime system development, navigational equipment, advanced thermoplastic composites, software development, luxury yacht and boat building, marine trades, and tourism. The Tiverton portion of the zone includes the proposed Tiverton Industrial Park situated on a 177-acre parcel located southeast of the intersection of Route 24 and Fish Road and the town’s burgeoning waterfront. During their 2014 zone re-designation, the towns’ requested the following changes: remove block group 3 of census tract 401.01, block group 1 of census tract 401.02 and census tract 417.02 while adding block group 1 of census tract 401.01 and block group 3 of census tract 401.02. These changes were proposed in order to re-establish the original intended geography of the zone except for the removal of census tract 417.02 in Tiverton which encompasses the southern portion of town including Four Corner, a very affluent area of town that already benefited from designation as an Arts and Entertainment District. The EZ Council unanimously approved the city’s proposed amendment to the zone as a part of their 2014 zone re-designation.</edomvd>
